# 15 Mistakes You Probably Make When Brewing Coffee


1. **Your coffee is not fresh** 
    - It’s pretty easy to spot a cup of stale coffee that’s sat out too long. But if you’re using old coffee beans, you might be sabotaging your brew with staleness before you even begin.
2. **Buying low quality coffee** 
    - you get what you pay for, and it couldn’t be truer when it comes to coffee. While bargain coffee might seem attractive to your wallet, your taste buds are likely to disagree.
3. Not measuring the coffee correctly 
    - 
4. **Using non optimal brewing method** 
    - Using different brewing methods can create cups of coffee with distinctively different levels of quality, taste, and aroma.
5. **Not buying whole bean coffee** 
    - Pre-ground coffee may be convenient. But the fact that it sits on the shelf until you’re ready to use it means the coffee has probably already given up the goods by the time it reaches you.
6. **Water temperature is off the mark**
    - The ideal coffee brewing temperature is between 195°F (90.6°C) and 205°F (96.1°C). In this range, your coffee can release its compounds properly and imbue your water with coffee goodness.
7. **Not grinding the coffee properly** 
    - When you grind coffee beans, strive for an even grind so all the coffee grounds are uniform, allowing water to filter through them and create a superb cup of coffee.
8. **Storing the coffee wrong way** 
    - Not all coffee bags are designed to store coffee for long periods of time. Oxygen and humidity are your coffee’s sworn enemies. Store your coffee in a cool, dry place, away from air, light, and extreme temperatures (hot or cold) for best results.
9. **Equipment is not up to the task**
    - Whether you’re partial to top-of-the-line espresso machine or use a hot water kettle to heat the water for your pour over coffee maker, keep an eye out for sudden changes in performance. If you notice your coffee’s quality dropping when you haven’t changed anything, it could be time to replace your brewing setup for one that’s up to snuff.
10. **Using the wrong kind of coffee cup** 
    - Always use high-quality glass or ceramic designed specifically for hot liquids when you’re ready for that morning mug. When you’re on the go, stainless steel travel mugs not only preserve your coffee’s taste, but can keep it hot and delicious for hours.
11. M**aking too much coffee** 
    - The larger the amount of coffee you make, the harder it is to get the best flavor, aroma, and finish from the ingredients.
12. Using low quality water 
    - 
13. **Not rinsing or replacing the coffee filter** 
    - If you use paper coffee filter, remove and discard them after every brew. Rinse the filter basket—if your machine has one—too.
    - If your coffee maker has a reusable filter, rinse it out thoroughly after every brew, and replace it if you notice your coffee’s quality has gone downhill.
14. **Not cleaning the coffee maker** 
    - The specifics of how to clean a coffee maker depend on the maker you prefer. No matter which kind you use, a regular and thorough cleaning will ensure your future brews are free of old grounds and contaminants.
15. **No idea what you like** 
    - This isn’t always a bad thing. Developing your palate and learning how you prefer your coffee takes time. But uncertainty can negatively affect the quality of your coffee when you brew it, since you’re “flying blind” and aren’t sure what it is you’re trying to achieve with your brew.
