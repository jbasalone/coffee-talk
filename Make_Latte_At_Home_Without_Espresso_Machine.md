☕️ Make Latte At Home Without Espresso Machine!!! 


Make espresso and fluffy milk?! That’s it!


## Ingredients:
- [Moka Pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot) 
- Coffee Grinder 
- Water
- A stovetop
- Milk


## For the ESPRESSO: Making it rich and concentrated
## Preparation:
1. Separate the 3 chambers of Moka pot
2. Fill the bottom chamber with water until the reservoir (round chamber.) Overfilling will water-log the coffee and affect the flavor, so make sure you don’t use too much.
3. Fill the funnel with ground coffee (grind number between drip and espresso.) Do not pack the grounds; just level off!
4. Reassemble and screw the chambers tightly
5. Select a burner size that fits the bottom of the Moka Pot. For gas stovetop, make sure the flame is not larger than bottom of pot (you don’t want to flame to come around the sides). Place the Moka pot on the stovetop until the water boils and coffee begins to make a gurgling sound during this process. Take your time – to extract the full flavor of the espresso, you will want to heat it slowly
6. When the top of the Moka Pot is full of coffee and hazel brown foam begins to appear out of the spout, remove from stove. This foam appears just seconds before the coffee is completely done, so as soon as it appears, your brew is done!



## For the MILK: Foamy and light
## Preparations: 

**Whisk and Stove** **Method** (big, airy and fluffy bubbles)

1. pour milk into a pan and whisk it for 2-5 minutes while heating the milk on medium-low heat 
2. remove the pan when it fluffy and warm

**French Press** **Method** (very velvety, smooth and rich)

1. fill the french press with cold milk halfway
2. insert the plunger and pump it until foamy and thick 
3. place it in microwave in save container for 30 seconds 

**Jar** **Method** (smooth and a bit more fluid)

1. fill the jar with cold milk halfway 
2. seal it tightly and shake it for 30 seconds or until frothy 
3. place it in microwave in save container for 30 seconds 


## Serving Suggestions:
- cold milk froth better than warm, because milk’s proteins are more stable when cold
- higher fat milks creates richer foam and more body, but lower fat creates more foam
