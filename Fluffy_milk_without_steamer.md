# Fluffy milk without steamer 

## Preparations: 

**Whisk and Stove** **Method** (big, airy and fluffy bubbles)

1. pour milk into a pan and whisk it for 2-5 minutes while heating the milk on medium-low heat 
2. remove the pan when it fluffy and warm

**French Press** **Method** (very velvety, smooth and rich)

1. fill the french press with cold milk halfway
2. insert the plunger and pump it until foamy and thick 
3. place it in microwave in save container for 30 seconds 

**Jar** **Method** (smooth and a bit more fluid)

1. fill the jar with cold milk halfway 
2. seal it tightly and shake it for 30 seconds or until frothy 
3. place it in microwave in save container for 30 seconds 


## ðŸ’ª Pro Note : 
- cold milk froth better than warm, because milkâ€™s proteins are more stable when cold
- higher fat milks creates richer foam and more body, but lower fat creates more foam
