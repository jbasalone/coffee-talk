 ## ☕️ Pour Over

Serves : 1


## Ingredients:
- 20/21 grams fresh grind coffee 
- 350 grams hot water 
- [Hario V60](https://www.amazon.com/Hario-V60-Coffee-Pour-Bundle/dp/B011VZ8V8A) / [Chemex Pour Over Glass](https://www.amazon.com/Chemex-Classic-Pour-over-Glass-Coffeemaker/dp/B0000YWF5E/ref=sr_1_3?crid=WJC2BVTYKN81&dchild=1&keywords=chemex+pour+over+coffee+maker&qid=1590426631&s=home-garden&sprefix=chemex%2Cgarden%2C196&sr=1-3)
- Paper filter
- Scale 


## Instruction:
1. Place the Hario V60/Chemex on the scale and tare your scale to zero. 
2. Put the paper filter into the dripper 
3. Wet the paper filter with just enough hot water to saturate it. This reduces any potential for a "paper taste" in your coffee. 
4. Add coffee grounds to the filter and shake gently to settle.
5. Add just enough water to cover the coffee grounds (60-70 grams of water) so the coffee can "bloom." Then wait 30 seconds. This is a step that [**lets gas escape**](https://www.roastycoffee.com/coffee-bloom/) from the coffee to help improve the overall flavor.
6. After the bloom, start pouring the remaining hot water over the coffee in small circles. Focus your pouring mostly in the inner circle, pouring near the edges occasionally to consistently wet the grounds. After blooming, pour about 200 grams water, try to never let the grounds go completely dry. Pour the rest of the water in the same circle way. **Total pour time should take 3.5 minutes.**
7. Once brewed, remove filter and enjoy coffee. 

**Bonus tip**: Before pouring coffee, warm your cup using any leftover hot water. Just be sure to dump the excess water before enjoying your coffee.
