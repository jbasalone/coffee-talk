# French press Coffee 
Serves 4

**INGREDIENTS**

- 1/2 cup freshly roasted coffee beans
- 4 cups water
- French press

**Steps**

1. Preheat the French press by filling it with hot water
    1. this step will make sure the whole coffee maker stays warm during the entire brew process — ensuring you get all those tasty flavors out of the grounds and into your cup
2. Grind the beans on the coarsest setting in the grinder.
3. Heat the water to boiling, then cool for 1 minute. Water for French press coffee should be heated to 195°F (If you want to make extra-sure it's the right temperature, use a thermometer to check.)
4. Add coffee grounds and pour the water into French press. (Don’t forget to dump the water, used to preheat the french press at first step)
5. Steep for 4 minutes to brew
6. When the timer goes off, press the plunger all the way to the bottom.

**Note**

- If you are not going to drink the coffee immediately, don't leave it in the French press, where it will continue to sit on the grounds and get bitter.
