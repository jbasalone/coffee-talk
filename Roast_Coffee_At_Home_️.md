# ‚òï Roast Coffee At Home ‚òïÔ∏è



1. Buy green coffee beans ( I would suggest to get this [Ethiopia](https://www.sweetmarias.com/ethiopia-organic-dry-process-limu-kossa-farm-6290.html) from Sweet Maria) 
2.  Buy two pounds if you want a pound of roasted beans ( Beans lose half of their weight in a roasting process) 
3. Place beans in a [sheet pan](https://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/williams-sonoma-goldtouch-three-quarter-sheet-pan/?pkey=s%7Csheet%20tray%7C28)
4. Heat up the oven to 500 degrees F
5. Place the sheet pen in the oven
6. Agitate the pan every 2 minutes
7. Listen for the first crack ( This may happened in between 5 -7 minutes)
    1. The beans will start changing color from green to yellow to brown.
    2. Start listening for the first crack once they start turning light brown. 
8. Check the beans for color 
9. Take the beans out when brown ( It could be 1 min. or 2 min. after they stop cracking)
10. Transfer the beans into a different pan 
11. Cool the beans for a few hours


**Few things to keep in mind**: 

- The beans are slowly off-gassing carbon dioxide so you would want to wait a day or two to start using the beans. 
- After the first crack you will notice a lot of chaff. Just blow it off the top once the roasting process is done. 
- The roasting process may also create a lot of smoke. Nothing to worry about, just turn the smoke detector off. üôÇ
