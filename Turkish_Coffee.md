# ‚òïÔ∏è Turkish Coffee 

I‚Äôm very excited to share with you the way of how we make a Turkish coffee at home.
This coffee has a variety of names, it depends in which country you are in.
In Greece they call it ‚ÄúGreek coffee‚Äù, in Armenia ‚ÄúArmenian coffee‚Äù, etc. üòÜ

It‚Äôs easy to make, takes max 5 min and it‚Äôs also a very enjoyable drink.

1. Add water to the [Cezve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cezve) (1.7 oz) for 1 cup of coffee.
2. Add sugar if you want otherwise skip.
3. Add 2 teaspoons of coffee.
4. Bring it to a first boil for 2-3 min.
5. Stir it for a few seconds.
6. Let it boil in medium heat and the coffee will start coming up slowly.
7. Before the [Cezve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cezve) is full to the top take it away from the fire.
8. Start pouring the coffee in the cup slowly just to create a great crema.



## Tips
- Coffee beans should be  always grounded very fine for Turkish coffee
- In case you want to make it lighter or to be cooler fast,  just add an ice cube after you pour the coffee in your cup.
- You can always add 1-2 cinnamon sticks before you add the coffee in the boiling water for more aroma/taste.
- Butter cookies taste even better with Turkish coffee.


## **Enjoy! üòÄ**
