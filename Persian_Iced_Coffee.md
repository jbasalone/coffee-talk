# üçßCafe Gelase ( Persian Iced Coffee) 
Coffee Dessert

With this incredibly sunny and warm weather, I thought it‚Äôs not too early in the year to share Persian style of ice coffee recipe with you. Probably every nation has its own take on ice coffee and of course there also is a Persian version, which we call *Caf√® Gelas√®*.


----------

**Ingredients:**


- 400ml milk (2 cups)
- 4 tsp instant coffee 
- 4 tsp sugar (or as much/little as you like)
- 4 scoops chocolate or vanilla ice cream
- Chocolate syrup
- Spray cream (or whipped cream)
----------

**Instructions:** 

1. Transfer the milk in into a small pan. Add the instant coffee and sugar and put it over low heat.
2. Once the coffee and sugar have dissolved, turn off the heat and let the coffee cool down. When it has reached room temperature, transfer it into cups, cover them, and let the coffee cool further in the fridge.
3. 10 minutes before serving you can put the serving glasses in the freezer to get them nice and cold.
4. If you want to whip your own cream, do it now.
5. Pour some chocolate syrup in the cold glasses, so it sticks to the inside of the glass. Add two scoops of ice cream each, pour the cold coffee on top, and top up with spray cream or whipped cream.
6. Top up with some more chocolate syrup if you like. You can garnish your ice coffee with crushed walnuts, pistachios, coffee beans, or anything you like.

Enjoy ;)
